## Scenario

- SensorSafe it's a visionary approach to redefine how we interact with and manage the environments we inhabit. In a world where safety, comfort and control are primordial SensorSafe emerges. It has the objective of managing all the Sensors in a building. This system was design to help different types of users, from house owners to the Building Manager, having control of the temperatures/humidity of his own divisions/apartments or even for a security context by having control of a smoke sensor to prevent a fire. We aspire to revolutionize how users perceive and interact with sensors by offering a unified system that transcends the boundaries of traditional applications. This system offers a full control of every type of sensors, allows users to have an app to manage them all, to prevent the need of the users to own multiple apps to control each one.	

## User Stories

```
