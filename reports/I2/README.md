Updates from Iteration 1.2

> IES_Project_Specification_ReportFinal Updates to the previous Iteration Topics

- Product requirements (User stories)

    - User Stroy 4 and 5
        - User Story 4 and 5 were a complement to each other, so we decided to merge them into one user story. A User Story more complete that covers all the requirements of the two previous ones.

    - Created a new User Story 5

> SensorSafe_Prototype.pdf

- Created a Prototype_PagesFlow.md file to better explain the flow of the prototype for a specific User Story.
