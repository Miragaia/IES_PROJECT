        npm start
        ```

    4. **Run the data generator:**
        - Open a terminal in the project [/data_generation](/data_generation/) directory
        - If you donÂ´t have the python packages installed, run the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        - Run the following command to start the data generator:
